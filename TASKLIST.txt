1. Bug when facing enemy => Jitter
2. Bug when no food or no weapon => Go back to exploring instead of finding closest house to revisit (might work correctly? Not sure)
3. Get rid of error messages in console
4. General cleanup
5. Ro5 implementations, coding standards
6. PRIORITY: Fix item replacement bug
7. Improve escape purge zone code

X. Optional:
	- Use combined steering (seek + wander) while exploring map
	- Remember whether houses still have items in them?
